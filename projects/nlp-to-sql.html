        <p class="mb-4">This application is a web-based platform that enables users to interact with datasets through natural language queries, making data analysis accessible to both technical and non-technical users. It allows users to upload datasets, explore their structure, and gain insights by asking questions in plain language. Leveraging machine learning and natural language processing, the application automatically interprets queries, generates appropriate operations, and presents results in a clear and understandable format. Additionally, it can provide comprehensive summaries of datasets, highlighting key attributes and patterns without requiring manual exploration. By simplifying data interaction, the application empowers users to extract meaningful insights quickly and efficiently.</p>

            <h2 class="font-bold mb-4">Overview of the Data Flow</h2>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Data Ingestion:</strong>
                    <p>Users begin by uploading a dataset in a supported format (e.g., CSV or JSON). The system processes the file to extract its structure, including column names, data types, and any relevant metadata.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Schema Extraction:</strong>
                    <p>Once the dataset is uploaded, the application analyzes its schema and stores this information for later use. This schema forms the basis for generating tailored queries and descriptive summaries.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Natural Language Input:</strong>
                    <p>Users can submit natural language queries about the dataset, such as asking for specific insights, aggregations, or filtering conditions. Alternatively, users can request a general description of the dataset.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Query Generation and Execution:</strong>
                    <p>Using a large language model (LLM), the system interprets the user’s query and generates a structured representation, such as an SQL query. The query is executed on the dataset, and the relevant results are returned to the user.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Dataset Summarization:</strong>
                    <p>For descriptive requests, the system uses the dataset schema and metadata to produce a natural language summary. This summary may include information such as column descriptions, data distributions, and key patterns.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Result Delivery:</strong>
                    <p>The output—either the results of the query or the dataset summary—is presented back to the user in a clear and easily understandable format.</p>
            </ol>
