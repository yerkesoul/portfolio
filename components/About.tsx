        I have a Master's degree in Cognitive Systems and extensive experience in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. My passion lies in developing innovative solutions that bridge the gap between human language and machine understanding. With a strong foundation in both theoretical concepts and practical applications, I strive to create impactful AI-driven systems that solve real-world problems.
